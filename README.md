# WATS 3020 - Introduction To JavaScript

This is the first Javascript coding assignment for WATS3020: Introduction to Javascript at Seattle University. The goal of this project is to illustrate an understanding of the basic concepts of Javascript, including variable assignment.

This assignment takes inspiration from the old game known as "Mad Libs". This is a common coding challenge, and there are many ways to solve it in every language. We are not aiming to create the most sophisticated, obscure or tiny implementation. We aim to create a clear, understandable logic that builds on the basic components of Javascript.

Requirements
============

Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

The format consist on a short story on with many key words replaced with blanks. Each blank is specified a lexical or other category, such as "noun", "verb", "place", or "part of the body". One player asks the other players, to contribute some word for the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical.

Base Requirements
=================

* Write a script to execute the Mad Libs format in the file `madlibs.js` and complete the Mad Libs story.
* Log all output to the console using `console.log()` statements.
* You will create variables that save "nouns", "verbs", "adjective", etc.
* Use proper variable scope and type definitions where appropriate.
* Use proper variable naming styles (camelCase) and comment your code to indicate functionality in plain (non-jargon) language.

Here is an example output that shows what any successful solution is going to give as a result:
```
Gonzo Klutz! What a(n) Mutual phrase

Gonzo Klutz! Ain`t no passing craze

It means no Hot Dogs for the rest of your Toads

It`s our Sincere philosophy

Gonzo Klutz!

Gonzo Klutz?

Yeah. It`s our Conditioner!

What`s a Conditioner?

Nothing. What`s a-Conditioner with you?

Those 7 words will Sputter all your problems

That`s right. Take Shawn here
Why, when he was a Wiry Peach...

When I was a Wiry Peach

Very Daffy

Thanks

He found his Innocence Smeared a certain appeal
He could clear the/a Albania after every Tableau

I`m a Biological soul though I seem Ideological
And it Brayed that my Pajama never stood downwind
And oh, the shame - He was ashamed
Thought of changin` my This What`s in a This?
And I got Certified How did ya feel?
Everytime that I...

Hey! Shawn! Not in front of the Errors!
Oh. Sorry

Gonzo Klutz! What a Mutual phrase
Gonzo Klutz! Ain`t no passing craze

It means no Hot Dogs for the rest of your Toads

It`s our Sincere philosophy
Gonzo Klutz!
Gonzo Klutz! Gonzo Klutz!
Gonzo Klutz! Gonzo Klutz!
Gonzo Klutz! Gonzo Klutz!
Gonzo Klutz! Gonzo Klutz

It means no Hot Dogs for the rest of your Toads

It`s our Sincere philosophy
Gonzo Klutz!
```

We will run your script in a standard Javascript console with no additional libraries installed to evaluate your success. We expect to see a result identical to the one provided above.

Stretch Requirements
====================

* Ask the user to fill in the blanks of the missing words to complete the story.
* Output the results of your script directly into the web page.
* Create your own Mad Libs story.

Tips
====

* You can write Javascript using the Developer Tools in any modern web browser. You can get tips about using Developer Tools all over. Here's a good place to start: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/authoring-development-workflow
* There are a lot of tutorials and discussions of Mad Libs online, and you are welcome to consult them. But please be aware that you may be spoiling the challenge for yourself, and that you may find people writing Mad Libs in ways that are exotic or obscure.
